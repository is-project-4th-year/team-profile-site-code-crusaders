## Things I have learned from Github

### 136242 Claire Muthoni 
I have learned how to use git branches and to add features separately from the main. This has been very insightful and has helped me sort out bugs and malfunctioning code indepenedently without breaking the work flow. 

### 148905 Estifanos Gebremedhin
I learnt the workflow of tasks in a GitHub project including how to create a milestone, an issue, how to commit changes, the conventional way to write commit messages, how to create and merge a pull request, how to create a branch rule and how to host a website using GitHub pages.

So far i have mastered core Git workflows syncing with git pull, hopping between branches using git checkout and spinning up feature and fix to isolate my work. I have also understood how to setup a milestone and issues in order to get organized and I cn spot and resolve merge conflictts.
